At the turn of the millennium, early 3D efforts such as Shenmue and Grand Theft Auto III set the blueprint of expansive spaces and nonlinear play, and by the mid-2010s, the games had evolved into near-photorealistic behemoths created by workforces spanning many continents. In 2018, Red Dead Redemption 2 — arguably the biggest, most convincing, and successful recent open-world title — pushed the ballooning approach to its logical extreme."
